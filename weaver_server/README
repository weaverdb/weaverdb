Issue an init_db command to create the base database system.  
The default user is the user who issued the command and the 
password is 'manager'

Start the database via the start_db command.  Once the database
is started issue mtpg/bin/psql -hlocalhost template1 to log
in.

There a number of basic testing files and dtrace scripts in the 
perf directory.

Stop the database via the stop_db command.


Feel free to contact me with any questions.
